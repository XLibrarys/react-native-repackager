# Repackager on RN51:

## Two ways to trigger 'repackager' on React Native 0.51.X (Wix flavor).

Let's say we want to load files with custom extension like `e2e.js`. We have two options:
### Method 1: CLI args on the packager.

Run the packager with this argument:
`react-native start —sourceExts=e2e.js`

It will load files that match `*.e2e.js` instead of regular ones.


### Method 2: Config file 

Create a file called ‘rn-cli.config.js’ in your module’s main dir (the one with package.json).

Put this inside : 

```
module.exports = {
 getSourceExts: () => ['e2e.js'] 
}
```

`getSourceExts` is a function that returns an array containing a list of custom source extensions. The array can contain multiple custom extensions, if you'd like.

It is recommended to turn the custom extensions on and off using an environment variable, like so : 

```
module.exports = {
 getSourceExts: () => process.env.RN_FLAVOR === 'E2E' ? ['e2e.js'] : []
}
```

Where env variable RN_FLAVOR controls which files we load.



Method 2 works for release builds as well.
